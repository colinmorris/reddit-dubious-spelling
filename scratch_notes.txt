Re...

word, optional space, open paren, case-insensitive "sp", then...
- elling, ? or )
- ) (then space, punct, or $ ?)
- ?

Probably favour precision over recall. The simple (sp?) pattern will already have a pretty good recall.

Of course, need to capture word that precedes, to which the sp applies.

(?:^| )([0-9A-Za-z\047-]+) ?\([sS][pP](?:elling)?\??\)
^[^&].* ([0-9A-Za-z\047-]+) ?\([sS][pP](?:elling)?\??\)
(?m:^[^&].* ([0-9A-Za-z\047-]+) ?\([sS][pP](?:elling)?\??\))
Explanation:
- Space preceding word
- alphanumeric-punctual word
- optional space
- open paren
- sp (case insensitive)
- optional "elling"
- optional ?
- close paren

Could try to be clever and capture multi-word expressions preceding the sp? if they're enclosed in quotation marks, or if they're all capitalized.

Could also allow some markdown frippery.

Maybe exclude "(SP)" because it's more likely to be a country indicator?

More liberal(?) re to comm with

\([sS][pP](\?|elling|\))

Explanation:
- open paren
- sp (case insensitive)
- ? or "elling" or close paren

SELECT REGEXP_EXTRACT(body, r"(?:^| )([0-9A-Za-z\047-]+) ?\([sS][pP](?:elling)?\??\)")

TODO: remember to delete tables in bigquery

NS:

0. think about what kinds of viz/analysis would be useful...
    - simple bar chart of most sp?'d terms (ideally including variant spellings)
    - some viz of popularity of different mispelled forms of words (could be esp. cool as some kind of sankey diagram)
    - which terms are people under-confident about (they usually use the correct spelling with sp) vs. ones that are most often mispelled when accompanied by sp
    - Maybe pick out top ten sp'd terms (or just select by some subjective criteria of interestingness) and try to come up with one viz that shows their frequency relative to each other, as well as the relative frequencies of different forms within a word. Could be a stacked bar chart, for instance. Or do a treemap per word - I like that.
- If you wanna be really proper, could do some hacking to properly split out half-suitcases like 'disease', 'acid', and last names.
x1. Case normalization
2. Clustering
    Input: set of word forms
    Output: list of sets of word clusters?
    Orrr....
    Input: dict mapping word forms to counts
    Output: dict mapping 'canonical' word form (one with highest count) to set of related word forms?
2.5: bigrams? acid, syndrome, park (too varied to crack top 10), disease (also prob too varied),
    Are any of them focused enough to make top 10? Acid = 72, park = 68, syndrome=61, effect=38. These are basically upper bounds on any bigram that includes them as the 2nd word... Whereas top 15 all have 90+ across forms.

If you're doing the thing where you focus just on visualizing the alternative forms, maybe should actually requery the data in a way that's not limited to forms followed by (sp?). cf. pushshift's reddit_one_word_frequencies.csv.xv
OTOH, limiting to instances with (sp?) might give more variety / a higher mispelling rate.

Another interesting q: which words are most frequently sp'd relative to how often they're used? i.e. what % of the time that someone tried to type 'Gyllenhaal' do they add sp?

Ooh another one: has the rate of (sp?) usage changed over time? Hypothesis: it's decreased over time as browsers with builtin spellcheck have increased in popularity? (Also mobile usage with smart keyboards). Would have to control for other factors - focus on a specific subreddit?
